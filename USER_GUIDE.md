# User Guide: Apple Music Theme

## Overview
This theme transforms Obsidian into a visually stunning environment inspired by the Apple Music Desktop app (Dark Mode), featuring the requested "Fire Orange" accent color.

## Installation & Activation

1. **Open Obsidian Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Appearance**.
3. Under **Themes**, click the dropdown (currently showing "Default" or "Minimal").
4. Select **AppleMusic**.
5. Ensure **Base color scheme** is set to **Dark**.

## Recommended Settings for Best Experience

### Appearance
- **Translucency effect**: **On** (This enables the blurry sidebar background).
- **Window frame style**: **Hidden** (This integrates the title bar with the sidebar).
- **Font**: The theme uses System Fonts (`-apple-system`). You do not need to install anything extra.

### Plugins (Optional but Recommended)
- **Hiding UI**: To get the cleanest look, you might want to collapse the right sidebar.

## Customization
The theme uses CSS variables. You can override them using a snippet if needed, but the defaults are tuned for the "Fire Orange" (#E85D3D) aesthetic.

## Troubleshooting
- **If colors look wrong**: Ensure you are in Dark Mode.
- **If elements look standard**: Make sure no other CSS snippets are conflicting. You might want to toggle off other snippets in *Appearance > CSS snippets* to see the pure theme.
