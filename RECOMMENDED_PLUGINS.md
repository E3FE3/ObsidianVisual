# Recommended Plugins for Apple Music Experience

To achieve the 100% "Apple Music Desktop" look, CSS alone isn't enough. You need to hide standard Obsidian window elements.

## 1. Hider (Highly Recommended)
This plugin is essential to hide the window frame, title bar, and scrollbars, which gives the app that "native" feel.

- **Install**: Go to *Community Plugins* -> *Browse* -> Search for **"Hider"** -> *Install* & *Enable*.
- **Configuration**:
  - Toggle **ON**: "Hide app ribbon" (The left strip with icons).
  - Toggle **ON**: "Hide window frame" (Removes the top white/gray bar).
  - Toggle **ON**: "Hide scrollbars" (Makes them overlay/invisible).
  - Toggle **ON**: "Hide status bar" (Optional, for cleaner look).

## 2. Style Settings (You have this installed!)
This theme is compatible with Style Settings. I will add support in a future update to let you tweak the "Fire Orange" color if you want, but for now, it's hardcoded for the perfect match.

## 3. Iconize (obsidian-icon-folder)
You have this! Use it to set folder icons to "SF Symbols" (if available in an icon pack) or simple feather icons to match the Apple sidebar aesthetic.
